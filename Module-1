Command Line Basics

Basic Commands

    cd - this means change directory
    ls -l (mac), dir (windows) - this will list out all of the files and directories under the current directory
    pwd - print working directory will give you something like /Users/wesbos/beginner-JavaScript/exercises
    cd .. - go up a level in the current directory
    
Check that Node.js is working
    
    If you want to see if your Node.js is working, you can type NODE in ther terminal and that will give you a caret which will load up a REPL which is a read-eval-print loop.
   
Running and Loading JavaScript

    in the browser console
    in node
    via a script tag
    we can also have an external script.
   
Variables and Statements

Variables are a building block of JavaScript, and you can't use JavaScript without knowing variables.

We will cover what they are, what the different types of them are, what declaration means as well as what a statement is in JavaScript.

There are three different ways to make a variable, which in JavaScript we refer to as declaring a variable. They are:

    -var
    -let
    -const
    
Var= To make a variable you type var and then you make a name of the variable. 
You can use almost anything for a variable name.

 <body>
  <script>
    var first = 'wes';
    console.log(first);
  </script>
</body>

Let= he second way to declare a variable is with let.
Below the declaration of the variable first.

let age = 300;

Const= The third way is with const. Below the age variable.

const cool = true;

Code Blocks

One thing that we will run into in JavaScript is something called a code block.
For example, add the following line of code to variables.html and refresh the page.

Before

if (age > 10) {
  console.log("you are old");
}

After

if (age > 10) {;
  console.log("you are old");
};

That is because it's something that is referred to as a code block.

Code blocks are things that are bound by these curly brackets { and }.

Things like function definitions, if statements, loops do not need a semi-colon at the end because you aren't telling the computer to do something. In those instances, you are just running some code and telling the computer to do something inside of the block.

Throughout the course Wes will continue to mention why we do and do not use the semi-colon so you can get the hang of it.

Scoping

Scoping in JavaScript answers the question "Where are my variables available to me?"

We are going to have an entire section of this course focused on scoping because it's such a fundamental part of JavaScript, but for now we need to know that:

    -var variables are scoped differently than let and const variables.
    -var variables are what we refer to as function scoped variables (they are only available within the parent function).
    -let and const variables are what we refer to as block scoped variables.

Types 

So far, we have just been assigning values to variables, such as numbers, text, true or false. What are all those things, and what are all of the different possible options that we have? These are referred to in JavaScript as Types.

Anytime that you have a value (a value is something that can be stuck inside of a variable, or passed to a function), it will fall into 1 of the 7 JavaScript types.

The types in JavaScript can be remembered using the word SNOB'N'US (just kidding, that is pretty hard to remember).

The 7 different types in JavaScript are:

    String - a string is anytime that you have some text (you will often see that in a single or double quote or a backtick.)
    
    Number - a number (regardless of whether it has a decimal place in it. Some programming languages have multiple types to deal with numbers, but JavaScript only has the one.)
    
    Object - this is a special one, we will go over this one last. Everything in JavaScript is an object, and we will understand what that is when we start to hit methods. Everything that we use like functions, dates, and arrays are just objects at the end of the day. All the other types except for object are referred to as the "primitive types".
    
    Boolean - true or false.
    
    Null - can be used to set a variable to nothing (we will discuss difference between undefined and null shortly).
    
    Undefined - can be used to set a variable to nothing (we will discuss difference between undefined and null shortly).
    
    Symbol - this is a new one to JavaScript, and it will always give us a guaranteed unique identifier. This is useful for when you are trying to come with a unique identifier inside of an object and you want to make sure you are not also overwriting something that already exists with that id.
   
JavaScript Comments

Difference between Single Quotes, Double Quotes and Backticks.

What is the difference between single quotes, double quotes and backticks?

Single quotes and double quotes are exactly the same thing.

The only reason that we have them both is because if you had a sentence like const sentence = 'she's so cool';, it would break your JavaScript because the JavaScript interprets the apostrophe as closing the string.

If you were to make that change, save the file and then refresh type.html, you will see an error that says.

const sentence = `she's so "cool"`; exmpl

Concatenation and Interpolation

const hello = "hello my name is" + name + ". Nice to meet you.";

But if you do "1" + "1", it will evaluate to "11".

If you do "1" + 1, it will also evaluate to "11".

1 + 1 = 2;

Backticks

To reiterate: you can do multiple lines with backticks, variable interpolation, and then there is something a little more advanced that is called a tagged template literal, but we are not going to get into that because we haven't got into functions just yet.

Finally, this will be very helpful for creating HTML in our JavaScript code.

const html = `
  <div>
    <h2>${name}</h2>
    <p>${hello}</p>
  </div>
`;

Helper Methods.

There are four you are most likely to use.

    Math.round()
    Math.floor()
    Math.ceil()
    Math.random()

Let's go through each one, starting with Math.round().

To use Math.round(), you pass a value in between the parenthesis () (that is referred to as passing a value, which we will go over in a future video). It will return to you the number that was passed in, rounded up or down depending on the number.

There is also Math.floor() which will give you the lower end of that number.

We have Math.ceil() and that will give you the upper number.

Then there is Math.random() which will give you a random number every time between 0 and 1 (in a future video we will go over how to get a random number between 1 and 10).

The end!
